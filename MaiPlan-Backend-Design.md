## Overview
The purpose of this document is to explain the objectives of the project, provide a detailed overview of its technical challanges and their solutions. Furthermore to provide insight into future plans and upcoming implementations. This project represents both a personal learning journey and the realization of my girlfriend's dream project. It is an exploration of different areas within software engineering, where I experiment, overengineer, and get lost in various concepts purely for the sake of learning. Additionally, any ideas or suggestions she brings forward, as well as changes she envisions, are considered an integral part of the project's scope and ongoing development.
